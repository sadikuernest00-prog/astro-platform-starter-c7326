**AmicBridge connects private lenders and private borrowers — safely and simply.**

We introduce people who want to lend money to people who want to borrow money.
We do not hold money, approve loans, or guarantee agreements.
AmicBridge is a quiet meeting place where people can find each other and make private arrangements on their own terms.

How It Works

Tell us whether you want to borrow or lend, and the amount and time frame.
We look in our private network for someone who fits.
If you decide to connect with that person, you pay a small introduction fee and we share their direct contact details.

All conversations, checks, contracts, and money transfers happen outside AmicBridge, directly between you and the other party.

What You Can Do Here

Borrowers can explain how much they need, for how long, and what they can realistically repay.
Lenders can explain how much they want to lend and what kind of borrower they are looking for.
If there is a good fit on both sides, we make a private introduction.

Important

AmicBridge is not a bank, broker, or financial advisor.
Borrowing and lending both involve risk, including the possibility of losing money.
You are responsible for your own due diligence, agreements, and decisions with anyone you meet through AmicBridge.
