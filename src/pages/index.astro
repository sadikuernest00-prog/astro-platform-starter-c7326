**AmicBridge connects private lenders and private borrowers — safely and simply.**

We do not hold money, approve loans, or guarantee agreements.  
AmicBridge is a meeting place where people can find each other, talk, and make private arrangements on their own terms.

### How It Works
1. Create a profile as a lender or borrower.  
2. Post what you’re offering or looking for.  
3. Use our messaging system to connect privately.

Everything about money happens *outside* our platform — we are only the bridge between people.

### What You Can Do Here
- Create a verified profile.  
- Post borrower requests or lender offers.  
- Communicate privately and securely.  
- Build trust with ratings and reviews.  
- Follow clear safety guidelines to stay protected.

AmicBridge is about **connection**, not control.  
You stay in charge of your agreements — we simply help you meet the right people.
