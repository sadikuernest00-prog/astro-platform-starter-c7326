**AmicBridge connects people who want to borrow money with people who want to lend money — privately and securely.**

If you need funding or you have capital to lend, we introduce you to a suitable person from our private network.
No public listings, no accounts, and AmicBridge never touches your money — everything stays between you and the other party.

### For Borrowers
- Borrow money directly from private lenders  
- Use it for personal needs, business, property, or projects  
- Simple, fast, confidential communication  
- You and the lender agree on terms privately  

Tell us how much you want to borrow and your repayment plan.

### For Lenders
- Lend your own capital directly to real people  
- Choose amount, purpose, and risk level  
- Keep full control of your decisions  
- No commissions or percentages taken from your deal  

Tell us how much you want to lend and what type of borrower you prefer.

### How AmicBridge Works
1. **You message us privately** and tell us what you need — borrow or lend.  
2. **We search our private network** for someone suitable.  
3. When we find a match, **you pay a small introduction fee**.  
4. After payment, we unlock **the direct contact details** of the other person.  

All conversations, negotiations, agreements, and money transfers happen directly between you and the other party — not through AmicBridge.

### How You Pay AmicBridge
AmicBridge charges a **fixed introduction fee** when you want to unlock a match.
No commissions, no success fees, and no hidden charges.  
You only pay when you decide an introduction is valuable.

### Important Notice
AmicBridge is **not a bank, broker, or advisor**.  
We do **not** arrange payments, hold money, or guarantee any outcomes.  
Borrowing and lending always involve risk, including the possibility of losing money.  
You are responsible for your own checks, agreements, and decisions with anyone you meet through AmicBridge.
